MBXMapKit
---------

**MBXMapKit is deprecated in favor of the [Mapbox iOS SDK](http://mapbox.com/ios-sdk) 2.0.0 and above. The future of Mapbox maps is vector rendering, and Apple shows no signs of allowing custom vector rendering in MapKit, so we recommend that you use the OpenGL-based Mapbox iOS SDK 2.0.0 instead.**

**NOTE: Unlimited, per-user Mapbox pricing plans cannot be used with this version of the Mapbox iOS SDK.**

See [this doc](README-old.md) for the original project details.
